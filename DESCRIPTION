Title: Climate-sensitive Growth and Mortality in LandR 
Description: This package contains climate-sensitive growth and mortality function for LandR.
    Some flexibility exists in how climate-sensitivity is derived, however the simplest
    and most robust method is to use the SpaDES modules 'PSPclean' and 'gmcsDataPrep'.
